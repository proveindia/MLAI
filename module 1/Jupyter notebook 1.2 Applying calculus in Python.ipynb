    "\n",
    "Calculus provides essential tools for understanding and optimising functions. The derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to a single variable, helping to identify maxima, minima and points of inflection. For functions of multiple variables, partial differentiation calculates the derivative with respect to one variable while keeping the others constant, enabling the analysis of complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The norm quantifies the size or length of a vector and is often used to measure distances or magnitudes in multi-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these concepts, gradient descent is an iterative optimisation algorithm that uses the gradient (a vector of partial derivatives) to move towards a function’s minimum by stepping in the direction of steepest descent. It is widely used in ML and numerical optimisation.n."
